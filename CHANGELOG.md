# Changelog

## 0.3.0

Chosen from probing the engine against nvim for gaps (a batch of 110 ad hoc daily-use cases; the failures became this
release) and from the 0.2.0 note that the renderer still folded the library's classes onto twelve.

- Insert-mode abbreviations (`:ab :iab :noreab :inoreab :unab :iunab :abc :iabc`), checked against nvim (corpus 104).
- `:let` variables (`g:` scope, `+= -= *= .=`) usable in `\=` and `:echo`; `\=` with a variable matched nvim.
- Richer highlighting: the renderer draws every class of the `syntax` library instead of folding onto twelve.
- `gw` keeps the cursor on blank text through a join and when nothing changes (it moved one column).
- A command that changes nothing (`x` on an empty line) no longer enters the change list or sets the `.` mark, so
  `g;` and `` `. `` match nvim.

Known gaps: abbreviations in the command line, non-id abbreviations expand only on `<Esc>`/`<CR>`/`CTRL-]`,
tab pages (`:tabnew`), `:ab` listing format, `gw` cursor after a re-wrap that moves it to another line.

## 0.2.0

Highlighting by the shared `syntax` library (see RENAMES.md).
